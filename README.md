Resources for the paper "Morpheme Sense Disambiguation: A New Task Aiming for Understanding the Language at Character Level" (LREC-COLING 2024)

# general description

Our MorDis resource for Chinese MSD includes one morpheme inventory (\textbf{MorInv}) and two morpheme annotated datasets (\textbf{MorTxt} and \textbf{MorWrd}) for in-text and in-word MSD.

Due to the restriction of intellectual property of the Chinese Contemporary Dictionary, we paraphrase the senses using ChatGPT and release a subset of MorDis covering 7930 frequently used morphemes of the 3000 most frequently used characters.
These sampled resources are uploaded to `data/`
